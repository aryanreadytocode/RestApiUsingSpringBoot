Cascade:
When we perform some action on the target entity, the same action will be applied to the associated entity.

All JPA-specific cascade operations are represented by the javax.persistence.CascadeType enum containing entries:

1. All
2. PERSIST 
3. MERGE
4. REMOVE
5. REFRESH
6. DETACH

Hibernate Cascade Type:
Hibernate supports three additional Cascade Types along with those specified by JPA.
These Hibernate-specific Cascade Types are available in 
org.Hibernate.annotation.CascadeType

Bidirectional relationships in Jackson.
JsonManageReference: It is the forward part of reference- the one that gets
serialized normally.
JsonBackReference is the back part of reference - it will be ommited from serialization.
The serialized Item object does not contain a reference to the User object.
